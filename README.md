## Focus of this workshop
The focus of this workshop is best practices for JavaScript development. Rather than laying out "rules" to follow we are going to take a look a the _why_ behind the best practices, so that you can decide for yourself what's best for you.

## What you need
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

## How to get started

* Start by cloning this repository into a folder on your computer. If you've never used git before, you can alternatively use the the "Download ZIP" button to the right.
* Although you have this `README.md` file on your computer it's easier to read it on GitHub, so we recommend you keep this page open with the exercise tasks.

## Exercises
This repository contains a set of exercises organized in folders. Each folder contains a `README.md` describing the exercise

- [Exercise 1 - Syntax](exercise-1/) (start here)
- [Exercise 2 - Equality](exercise-2/)
- [Exercise 3 - Hoisting and scope](exercise-3/)
- [Exercise 4 - Patterns](exercise-4/)
- [Feedback](feedback/) (when you're done)

### Symbols and notation used in exercises

#### Icons with special meaning

:pencil2: - A task you should do  
:book: - A section of text to read (no tasks, just information).  
:bulb: - Additional information.  
:exclamation: - Something important.  
:question: - Open-ended question for the reader ("What do you think would happen if...")  
:poop: - Bad practice (don't-do-this)  
:star: - A bonus task (not required)  

#### Keyboard keys

Will look like this:

<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>

#### Diff blocks

Emphasizes how lines of text should change.

```diff
- this text was removed
+ and replaced with this text
```
