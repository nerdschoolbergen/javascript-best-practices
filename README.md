## Focus of this workshop
The focus of this workshop is best practices for JavaScript development. Rather than laying out "rules" to follow we are going to take a look a the _why_ behind the best practices, so that you can decide for yourself what's best for you.

## What you need
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)

## How to get started

* Start by cloning this repository into a folder on your computer. If you've never used git before, you can alternatively use the the "Download ZIP" button to the right.
* Although you have this `README.md` file on your computer it's easier to read it on GitHub, so we recommend you keep this page open with the exercise tasks.

## Exercises
This repository contains a set of exercises organized in folders. Each folder contains a `README.md` describing the exercise.

### TEMP:
- encapsulation: iife vs modules
- var vs let vs const, hoisting
- lexical scoping, bind/apply, lambdas
- immutability, spread, Object.assign

- [Exercise 1](exercise-1/) (start here)
- [Exercise 2](exercise-2/)
- [Exercise 3](exercise-3/)
