# Feedback

Thanks for completing our workshop :tada: !! We put a lot of time into making this as good as we possibly can, and we value your constructive feedback.

If you have suggestions or requests, found spelling mistakes, missing or lackluster explanations, or poorly designed exercises, we'd love to hear from you.

Thanks!
